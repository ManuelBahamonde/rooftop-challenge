# Rooftop Academy Career Switch 2022 Technical Challenge - Manuel Bahamonde
This repository contains my implementation of Rooftop Career Switch 2022 Technical Challenge.
# Technologies
In order to solve this challenge, I used the following technologies
* Vanilla Javascript (challenge logic)
* Jest (testing)
* Axios (simplifying API queries)
# Instructions
* Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/ "Title")
* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Enter your email in `config/config.json` file. This step is optional, you can use the default one if you want
* Run the app with `npm start`
# Testing
You can also test the app by using `npm test` (when testing, the app uses a mock API to avoid overloading the real one).
