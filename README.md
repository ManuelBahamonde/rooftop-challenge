# Installing Dependencies
Before running the app, you need to install the dependencies needed to do so by using `npm install`.
# Run the app
The easiest way to start the app is to run `npm start`.
# Testing
You can also test the app by using using `npm test` (when testing, app uses a mock API so we avoid overloading the real one).
